/*
 =====================
 This list defines the UID3 for the EXE/DLL in the Photo Browser
 
 By defining and undefining PROTECTED_UID, the build configuration 
  switches between the UID in the protected and unprotected range.
  
 When built with the protected UID and signed with the test 
  certificate, it works fine with Ivalo but Tube refuses to install.
  To try out something on Tube, you need to build with the 
  unprotected UID.

 The protected UIDs have been reserved for Photo Browser in the 
  S60 UID repository.
 
 =====================

 Don't forget to manually change this line in the package file. 
 
 ImagicApplication/group/Imagic.pkg:
 
 #{"Photo Browser" },(0x2002134F),2,2,1
